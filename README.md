# FastAPI

# Developed a Machine Learning Web Application using a Random Forest Classifier to predict the authenticity of banknotes with almost 90% accuracy.
# Used features like variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy from banknote images.
# Dataset sourced from UCI Repository and Kaggle, containing images of genuine and forged banknotes.

# HOW TO START THE START THE APP:

# First of all create a virtual env

# Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# In order to avoid conflict, delete the classifier.pkl file

# Run the model_training.py file

# New classifier.pkl file will be generated

# Now Run "uvicorn app: app --reload"
